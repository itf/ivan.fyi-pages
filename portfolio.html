Personal blog with stories about the time when I took part in Science Olympiads. At its peak, it received 50 unique visitors per day and top posts had a few dozen comments. It was created as a way to debunk myths about science olympiads as well as their competitors, as well as a way to stimulate people to take part in science olympiads, specially those from smaller towns around Brazil.<br> I was originally from a small town and I didn't know how other people prepared for science competitions, since no one was taking part on them in my hometown. Through my blog I tried to provide a way to help people in similar situations.<br> Some of the readers of the blog were later selected to represent Brazil on IBO, IPhO and IOAA, which was awesome.<br> There was a problem with the wordpress database and the website went offline after a few years without being maintained; now we have a snapshot of how it was so others can still access it.</div><div class=portfolio-project><h1 id=Olimpíadas_Científicas><a href=http://olimpiadascientificas.org/>Olimpíadas Científicas</a></h1><p><a href=/./png/bonecooc.png><img alt=img src=/./png/bonecooc.png></a><p>2009- now.

Dozens of volunteers have helped with the website, helping provide material, write news and find information about the competitions.<p>It was cited by the largest Brazilian newspaper in 2012, tinyurl.com/ocientificas.</div></div></div></main><footer><hr><div class=c><nav class=tpad><div><a title="Ivan.fyi Atom Feed" href=/atom.xml target=_blank type=application/atom+xml><i class="svg rss" title="Ivan.fyi Atom Feed" type=Button></i></a><a class="js m-protected" href=#aXRhZGV1ZmFAZ21haWwuY29t target=_blank title=Mail><i class="svg mail" title=Mail type=Button></i></a><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-tadeu-ferreira-antunes-filho-8b2b0950/ target=_blank title=LinkedIn><i class="svg linkedin" title=LinkedIn type=Button></i></a><a href=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan-Tadeu-Ferreira-Antunes-Filho/ target=_blank title=ResearchGate><i class="svg researchgate" title=ResearchGate type=Button></i></a><a href=https://github.com/itf/ target=_blank title=Github><i class="svg github" title=Github type=Button></i></a><a href=https://www.instagram.com/ivan_af_/ target=_blank title=Instagram><i class="svg instagram" title=Instagram type=Button></i></a></div></nav><p class=s90>© <span id=year>2025</span> Ivan.fyi<p class=s90>Powered by <a href=https://www.getzola.org/ target=_blank>Zola</a> & <a href=https://github.com/jieiku/abridge/ target=_blank>Abridge</a></div></footer><span class=topout> <span class=topleft> </span><a title="Back to Top" class=top href=#><i class="svgs svgh angu"></i></a> </span>
