I am of the opinion that rapid feedback is of main importance when learning new concepts, and courses should use current tools to do so when possible.\nExperience\nYou can see some of the recent things I've worked on on my portfolio or on my resume page, depending if you are interested in my side projects or more on academics and internships. \nAwards\nMIT competitions\n\n\nOur AugModules project, built by me and Allan Costa won the Verizon best IOT project at the Make MIT hackathon\nFirst place in the MIT Mobile Autonomous Systems LABoratory competition in 2015. \n\nMedals in Science Olympiads (2006-2013)\nI took part in multiple science olympiads back in highschool, here is a list of the competitions. \nInternational medals\n\nCompetitionYearMedalSubjects\nInternational Junior Science Olympiad (IJSO)2009SilverPhysics, Chemistry and Biology\nInternational Junior Science Olympiad (IJSO)2010GoldPhysics, Chemistry and Biology\nInternational Junior Science Olympiad (IJSO) – Team practical competition2010BronzePhysics, Chemistry and Biology\nInternational Physics Olympiad (IPhO)2011BronzePhysics\nInternational Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad (IOAA)2011BronzeAstronomy, Astrophysics and basic data analysis\nInternational Physics Olympiad (IPhO)2012GoldPhysics\nIbero-American Computer Correspondence Contest (CIIC)2011SilverInformatics\nPhysics Cup20128th placePhysics\nInternational Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad (IOAA)2012SilverAstronomy, Astrophysics and Basic Data Analysis\nIberoamerican Biology Olympiad2012SilverGeneral Biology\nIberoamerican Biology Olympiad – Rally (mixed countries team competition)2012GoldBiology, Team Work\nInternational Linguistics Olympiad (IOL)2012SilverLinguistics, Logic\nWorld Physics Olmpyad (WoPhO)2012/2013SilverPhysics\n\nAll medals\n\nCompetitionYearInternational/National/State/Regional/MedalSubjects\nLins Regional Mathematics Olympiad2006RegionalGoldMathematics\nLins Regional Mathematics Olympiad2007RegionalGoldMathematics\nBrazilian Mathematics Olympiad2007NationalGoldMathematics\nBrazilian Mathematics Olympiad2008NationalBronzeMathematics\nSao Paulo State Mathematics Olympiad2008StateGoldMathematics\nRio Preto Regional Mathematics Olympiad2008RegionalGoldMathematics\nBrazilian Mathematics Olympiad2009NationalHonorable MentionMathematics\nSao Paulo State Mathematics Olympiad2009StateGoldMathematics\nRio Preto Regional Mathematics Olympiad2009RegionalGoldMathematics\nBrazilian Physics Olympiad2009NationalGoldPhysics\nSao Paulo State Physics Olympiad2009StateGoldPhysics\nBrazilian Junior Chemistry Olympiad2009NationalSilverChemistry\nBrazilian Junior Science Olympiad2009NationalGoldPhysics, Chemistry and Biology\nInternational Junior Science Olympiad2009InternationalSilverPhysics, Chemistry and Biology\nBrazilian Astronomy Olympiad2009NationalSilverAstronomy and Astrophysics\nBrazilian Mathematics Olympiad2010NationalHonorable MentionMathematics\nSao Paulo State Mathematics Olympiad2010StateSilverMathematics\nRio Preto Regional Mathematics Olympiad2010RegionalGoldMathematics\nBrazilian Physics Olympiad2010NationalSilverPhysics\nSao Paulo State Physics Olympiad2010StateGoldPhysics\nBrazilian Chemistry Olympiad2010NationalHonorable MentionChemistry\nBrazilian Junior Science Olympiad2010NationalGoldPhysics, Chemistry and Biology\nInternational Junior Science Olympiad2010InternationalGoldPhysics, Chemistry and Biology\nInternational Junior Science Olympiad – Team practical competition2010InternationalBronzePhysics, Chemistry and Biology\nBrazilian Astronomy Olympiad2010NationalGoldAstronomy and Astrophysics\nBrazilian Informatics Olympiad2010NationalGoldProgramming\nBrazilian Mathematics Olympiad2011NationalBronzeMathematics\nSao Paulo State Mathematics Olympiad2011StateGoldMathematics\nBrazilian Physics Olympiad2011NationalSilverPhysics\nSao Paulo State Physics Olympiad2011StateGoldPhysics\nInternational Physics Olympiad2011InternationalBronzePhysics\nBrazilian Chemistry Olympiad2011NationalHonorable MentionChemistry\nOn-line Chemistry Contest2011NationalSilverChemistry\nSao Paulo State Chemistry Olympiad2011StateSilverChemistry\nBrazilian Physics Tournament2011NationalBronzePhysics and Argumentation.

The second thing was to add a (run-with-idle-timer 0.05 nil This adds a delay of .05 seconds before displaying or removing the image. This is particularly useful when scrolling, because, together with the while-no-input   it stops the function from running multiple times while you scroll, or move around the text quickly, or when you take multiple actions that take less than 0.05 seconds.\nAt last, I improved the performance considerably by using the trick I learned from  org-inline-image package, i.e that we can get the overlay at point and filter it by a specific property. This way instead of going through a potentially very large list of overlays, we make use of a function that was implemented in C, which is likely much faster, and we only have to go through all the overlays that are defined at point, which are likely much fewer than the number of overlays on the buffer. \nAt last I decided to byte compile the function, because, why not?

College app essay, partially erased and adapted to protect personal information.\nBaby deer\nWhen I was fourteen,  I was designated the responsibility of caring for a rescued newborn deer. A hunter had killed its mom and left it there to die. The deer was weak, dehydrated and hungry — on the brink between life and death.\nI named her “Lita.” In the beginning, she could barely bear her own weight. Each day I’d feed her with a little nursing bottle and play with her so she wouldn't feel lonely. Day by day, she was growing stronger. After three weeks she was able to walk and eat by herself, making my job much easier. She was cute and gentle — she always followed me at home and asked me for caress,touching my hand with her head.\nI started getting tired of taking care of her because it required so much time, but I couldn't go out and leave her alone. She was my responsibility. However, after one month I got bored and started to spend my time reading or playing on the computer. To be honest, I didn't want to keep looking after her. My routine was monotonous: putting milk in her plate, petting her and cleaning up her mess.\nShe grew stronger and I stopped being so cautious. One day, I forgot to check if her milk was still good in the afternoon. It had spoiled, and she died that same night. This happened because I wasn't doing the best I could. No one blamed me, but I knew I could’ve saved her. A little lapse of my attention cost Lita her life. I was sad, but learned an important lesson: the difference between success and failure lies in the details. Some times, it is not you that suffers by your errors, but the ones next to you, and this is what I won't ever allow to happen again. When I make other mistakes in the future, it won't be because of lack of effort. Since then, I have always and I will always try to do my best.\n","description":"","id":"/baby-deer.html","title":"Baby deer"},"/baby-white-woodpeckers-are-dumb.html":{"body":"So during my life I have helped take care of multiple birds (bem-te-vis, parrots, toucans, large hawks, tiny hawks, vultures, sparrows, doves, humming birds, canaries, woodpeckers, etc), usually baby ones who had their family killed by teenagers/hunters/superstitious people/fire, or old ones who were injured by electric fences/teenagers/people cutting their wings to sell, etc.  It is a long story…\nFor the longest time I though that doves were the dumbest birds. We could take care of them for multiple weeks while they recovered, but even past those weeks they'd still be really scared of us and would try to escape through a wall.  They never manage to learn that we were not a threat, and that they couldn't escape through a wall.\nBut now in January when I was back in my hometown, I helped take care of 2 baby white-woodpeckers. And they were a quite interesting bunch.\nThey also could not learn that we were not a threat, but, different from doves, they were not trying to fly through walls. They had this amazing concept on their minds that if they can't see you, you can't see them.\nIn good days, they'd try to find a corner to hide their head, or they'd try to hide their head under something. However, most times they'd just put their heads down while in the middle of the floor, in the middle of everything and try very hard to not look at you.\nThey also had very interest concepts about food. If the food is at their eye level, it is food.  Holding beetles' larvae at their eye level height with pincers was the way to go, as well as a mix of bird + dog food crunched and mixed together with water, that usually works really well for young birds.\nHowever as soon as food falls below their eye level, it is not food anymore.\nbaby woodpecker: Do you know this chunky larva crawling around on my feet? it''s always been there. There is no food near me.\nOne of them would also constantly attack the other sibling. The other sibling would follow the \"if I can't see you, you can't see me\" and hide its head. It would usually hide its head under the closest thing to it, which was its sibling who was attacking. It was not very effective.\nInteresting enough, if you separated both of them, they'd both try to get together, even though one of them was almost getting killed by the other.\nWe released them after 2 weeks, and after a few days of acclimatizing to the place they were going to be released ( we keep them in a very large bird cage thing, like 10 feet by 30 feet by 20 feet in the location. I think it is called a vivarium in English?).\nThe attacker sibling survived, the one being attacked disappeared after 2 days.\nI hope that the one who survived has found nice places to hide its head every time it gets scared.\nvideo-1545707561\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\n\n","description":"","id":"/baby-white-woodpeckers-are-dumb.html","title":"Baby white-woodpeckers are dumb"},"/blogging-past-and-not-blogging-rant.html":{"body":"I used to blog a lot in high school.\nOne blog I was really proud of was Ivan vida de olimpico, which was a website I wrote while I was taking part in science olympiads. The reason I wrote the website was to help incentive people to take part on science olympiads, by showing how I studied, telling stories about the competitions, showing how fun it was!\nBefore I stopped writing it, I had already reached the stage where was making my own bad drawings to better illustrate the stories\n\n\nIt was great! I received about 50 different visitors per day and answered comments in multiple of the posts. I had written some really great posts about motivation and study and really liked doing so. \nBesides my main blog, I also maintained the website olimpiadascientificas.com. We received about 500 visits per day, from all over Brazil. It was the first Brazilian website to help students take part in science olympiads, providing study guides, hints, instructions on how to take part on them and so on. \nBut then what happened?\nI was writing study guides to help people take part in the biology, lynguistics, physics, in 2012, because I had been first place in these 3 Brazilian olympiads in 2012. Taking part in these competitions and then getting to travel to other countries and make friends during the international competition was my life back in the day. They were really my life.\n\nHowever, 2 Brazilian schools who used to also send students to those competitions got pissed. Why did they get pissed? Maybe they truly thought with all their good hearts that I was just a horrible person. Or maybe because they considered that I was taking spots that could be used for their students in the international competitions. Or maybe because they profited from the fact that information was not easily available, so only their students would usually do well on the competitions (together with 2 other schools), which makes making information available strictly bad to them. I don't know, and any speculation is just speculation.\nSo they decided to threaten the organizers of some of those competitions in order to get me kicked out from them and have their students who were in 6th place take my place. \nWhen I say threaten, I do mean threaten. One of the organizers called me saying that they were threatening to sue him if he didn't kick me out (he stopped organizing the physics olympiad in Brazil shortly afterwards because those schools were so horrible to him). To try to justify what they were doing, they used the fact that I was writing study guides to the other competitions to say that I was not dedicating myself enough on my studies, because I should be focusing on a single subject. And they used my blog and website to try to make this case, and argue that focusing on multiple subjects went against the spirit of the competition.\nOne interesting fact is that those schools were also using the study guides and material that I had written…\n\nThey managed to get me removed from the International Biology Olympiad team. As well as cause me so much stress that I ended up losing my best friend for not being able to keep being a social person, and abandoning them in a moment of need. \nIt was a bit rough.\nIt was the first time I had experienced that what I considered to be trying to help others could backfire, because someone profits from them not being helped. It was the first time I had someone use information I was sharing to make a dossier against me. And so the first time I saw how important privacy, even for silly things, is; and that being able to freely speak your mind is more of a privilege than a right. \nSo for the longest time I've been afraid of writing stories or telling experiences. As well as extremely jaded about doing those things. I felt that writing about anything was a liability, a risk that I was no longer willing to take. \nBut a huge part of me want this to change. A huge part of me wants to be able to just write, and tell stories and share pictures without worrying. Maybe that is just being naive and living in a fairy tale, but it brings back a bit of magic to my life.

It suggested using xclip to access the\nclipboard.\nThe problem is that xclip causes emacs to hang, because it forks a\nchild that keeps stdout open. So instead, one can use the emacs backed\nfor getting the xselection from the clipboard.\nThis code requests a text/html selection and checks if it exists. If it\nexists, it first decodes it using whatever encoding was being used, and\nthen uses pandoc to convert the html to org mode.\n    (defun html2org-clipboard ()\n      \"Convert clipboard contents from HTML to Org and then paste (yank).\"\n      (interactive)\n      (let* (\n           (text_html (gui-backend-get-selection 'PRIMARY 'text/html))\n           (text_raw (gui-get-selection)) \n           (text_html (when text_html\n                        (decode-coding-string text_html 'unix)))\n           (text_html (when text_html\n                        (shell-command-to-string (concat \"echo \"  (shell-quote-argument text_html) \"|timeout 2  pandoc -f html-native_divs-native_spans -t org\"))))\n           (text (or text_html\n                   text_raw))\n           )\n        (progn  (kill-new text) (yank))))\n    \n    \n    (with-eval-after-load 'org \n      (define-key org-mode-map (kbd \"C-y \") 'html2org-clipboard)\n      (define-key org-mode-map (kbd \"C-&lt;tab&gt;\") '(lambda() (interactive) (save-excursion  (org-back-to-heading)\n                                                                      (org-cycle))))\n      )\n\n","description":"","id":"/emacs-drag-drop-pdfs-paste-html-custom-templates.html","title":"Emacs drag-drop pdfs, paste html, custom templates"},"/emacs-tramp-asking-for-password.html":{"body":"For about a week, every time I initialized emacs, Tramp would constantly ask for my password, both for sudo and for ssh.\nThis means that in the recent file list there is a sudo file or a ssh file, and everytime emacs initialize, it is trying to load this list (which requires it to re-ask for the password if it is not saved). \nIf this happens to you, the easiest fix is to clean the recent file lists by running:\n    (setq session-file-alist ())\n    (setq file-name-history ())\n\n\n","description":"","id":"/emacs-tramp-asking-for-password.html","title":"Emacs Tramp asking for password"},"/error-compiling-openssl-for-android.html":{"body":"errors such as ld: error: providers/libdefault.a(libdefault-lib-pbkdf2_fips.o) is incompatible with elf_x86_64\nJust run make clean before attempting to compile again\nAlso, just follow the android instructions on the openssl archive file you extract.\n","description":"","id":"/error-compiling-openssl-for-android.html","title":"Error compiling Openssl for android"},"/export-subtree-with-files.html":{"body":"Update:\nNow this is on on github, in the repo org-export-with-files.

It is very easy to use this org file to find information since every note contains links to the relevant papers.\nHowever, sharing this file with someone can be challenging, since I just want to share the relevant notes/papers and not everything that is linked by this file.\nThe code below solves this problem. It creates a hard link of every file linked by the specific headline into the export directory and fixes all the links in the exported pdf so that it points to the relative location of those files.\nThis allows me to quickly generate a folder that contains all the files I wanna share as well as a pdf that allows the other person to easily navigate through the files and see the relevant information.\nWarning:\nThe file links when exporting to latex need to be of the form [[] [name of the link]].

This post will\nfocus mainly on the software, but first, let's skim through the\nhardware.\nMaterial:\n\n70 meters of ws2812 strips\nA 90 amps, 5v power supply\n20 feet of gauge 2 stranded copper wire.\nA raspberry pi.\n2 ethernet cables.\nSpeaker wire (any other medium-large wire would also work)\nFemale header pins\nHot glue\nPlywood, 2x3s pieces of wood and diffuse vinyl fabric for the frame.\n\nConstruction\n\nThe construction was simple, but took around 40 man hours.\nFirst, we cut all the Led strips into 2meter strips, and soldered header\npins onto the cut parts.\nWe built the 1x2m frame by cutting the wood pieces onto the necessary\nlengths at the store. We drilled holes on the frame and tied all the led\nstrips onto it, and then hot glued the strips.\nFor the power, we had a 90A, 5V power supply, connected using 2 10 feet\ngauge 2 stranded copper wire (which minimized the voltage drop to around\n0.2v); on the sides of the frame we attached 8 strands of speaker wire\nand soldered wires to them.\nThe wires and strips were connected to each other, and held into place\nby hot glue.\nA raspberry pi connected to the Internet through Ethernet sends data to\nthe LEDs using a stripped Ethernet cable.\nSo far, the main difficulty was handling the voltage drop caused by\n90amps going through the wires. Just get larger wires and you'll be good\nto go, as long as you calculate the voltage drop before building it.\nSoftware\n\nThe software of this project was pretty fun to code and it is pretty fun\nto use in my opinion.\nAll of it can be found in the\ngithub repo of the project.\nIf you want to take a look at the details of each design choice, just\nread the read-me of the github repo. This post describes what motivated\neach design choice and when each module was built, and why.\nProgramming really complex effects is really hard and boring, so my main\nobjective was to make it possible to combine simple patters and effects\ninto more complex effects. More specifically those were the maing\nobjectives:\n1- Capable of creating new functions by combining previous ones 2-\nReacts to music / beats 3- Few dependencies / dependencies that are easy\nto install 4- Modular (can change the protocol to control other types of\nLED screens, LED strips, increase the number of strips being controlled,\nadd plugins, etc) 5- Mostly in a single language 6- Ideally,\ncommunication through UDP / WebRTC 7- Should run on Linux, Windows and\nMac.\nThis will be written in the order that things were coded. You should\nskip direct to the patterns and effects session to see the cool parts!\nStarting\nI started programming the led panel long before I had the LED panel. So\nthe first thing I needed, in my opinion, was a fake led panel.\nI found a friend's project Iron\nCurtain that had some code for a local display; a display that\nmimecked an led panel. So I\nmodified\nthe code to be able to handle an arbirtrary number of pixels.\nAfter I had a way of testing my code, I needed a way of sending data. I\nmade a\n\"Client\"\nand a \"Server\" that communicated using UDP. The client sent data to\nthe server, and the server sent the data to the local display. I wrote a\nfew\ntests to make sure everything worked.\nNow I needed a way to represent the pixels, in order to work with them.\nI wrote a\ncanvas\nclass that I could use to represent the pixels of the screen, and that\ncould handle all edge cases (for example, what to do when trying to\naddress a pixel that is not on the screen?) I decided to handle such\nedge cases by making the screen \"repeatable and infinite\" i.e. if you\naddress the pixel -1 you go back to the right most pixel.\nAfter all the basics were built it was time to start building the\npatterns.\nPatterns and effects\nPatterns objective:\n1- Be easy to modify or add effects (example: increase speed, change\ncolors, etc) 2- Be easy to combine 3- Possible to save to a file and\nload from files.\nHow to make patterns in a way that it is easy to combine?\nThere are basically two options of how to make the patterns: they can be\nfunctions or they can be objects.\nOne option was to have each pattern being an object, and having objects\nthat take other objects on their input to combine patterns. This would\nallow to have states in a very simple way, and change the states in each\nupdate. This is how 1e, a different hall in my dorm, does it, as seen on\ntheir gitrepo.\nIf they are functions they should be easier to compose; however, in\norder to have an internal state, one needs to use closure, which can add\na lot of complexity to the code.\nI first tried to make the patterns objects. But it was really hard for\nme to reason about what was the right behavior for the patterns and how\nto combine them in interesting ways without adding a lot of boiler plate\ncode. For example, what does it mean to take the mean of two (object)\npatterns? It means to call a function in the the first pattern to\ngenerate an image, do the same on the second pattern, and, at last,\ncreate a new object that implements a function that generates this\nparticulat image.\nInstead, I decided to make the patterns functions that, when possible,\ndon't haven an internal state.\nWhy no internal state?\nThe main advantage of not having an internal state is that it allows one\nto easily modify the patterns. Let's say that we want to generate a\ncircle that increases and decreases its size in each frame. One option\nis to create a pattern that contains the circle radius as part of its\ninternal state and at each frame it changes the circle radius. This\nworks, but is rather hard to modify.\nA simpler solution is to have a pattern that simply creates a circle and\ntakes as its input something that can be used to generate the circle\nradius. At each step, we can have this input change, and, this way, we\ncan create any kind of pattern that involves circles that change sizes.\nWhat about this input?\nYou might ask now, what about this input? Wouldn't it be very specific\nto each pattern and make it hard to modify or combine them? In theory,\nthis could be the case if you don't make the input generic enough. In\norder to have it as generic as possible, the input was simply a python\ndictionary.\nOn this input, which was conveniently called \"Pattern Input\" all the\nnecessary information related to patterns is stored. It stores the frame\nnumber, the canvas that will contain the image that will be generated,\nthe radius of the circle, audio information, etc. And any pattern could\npotentially modify it or have it modified by functions!\nFast development\nAfter defining the input to patterns all the development got faster.\nPatterns were defined as \"Functions that take pattern inputs and return\npattern inputs\" . Functions were defined as \"Functions that take\npatterns and return patterns\". Some of the basic patterns that I created\nwere: \"Red\": makes the canvas red. \"Circle\": makes a circle of radius\n\"cradius\". \"Trivial\": returns the same pattern input that it received.\nSome of the basic functions I created first were: \"hue\", shifits the hue\nof the image by an specied amount. \"Rainbow\": shifts the hue by an\namount linearly dependent on the position.\nSome of the auxiliary decorators I made in the code were: \"defaultArgs\":\nadd default arguments to the pattern input. An example is: the circle\ngets the radius from the pattern input. However, if the pattern input\nhas no info about the circle radius, it should be initialized to a\ndefault value.\nThis was enough to create many interesting and simple functions, but it\nwas not enough to generate arbitrarily complex functions.\nThe next milestone on the development, was when I created the function\n\"arg\". Arg is the only function in the code that doesn't immediately\nmodify a pattern.\nWhat is arg?\nI needed a way to modify the aruments to the functions. However, since\nevery function took a pattern and every pattern took a pattern input,\nthere was no where to modify the arguments themselves besides hard\ncoding them in the code. \"Arg\" is the function that solves this problem.\nArg is a function that takes a string and returns a \"Function\". Remember\nthat \"Functions\" are things that modify patterns. So far, \"arg\" is not\nspecial. The special part is that it runs the string as if it was python\ncode, but from inside the context of the \"Pattern Input\". In other\nwords:\narg(\"cRadius=frame/10.%20\")(circle)\nIs a pattern that generates a circle whose radius depends on the frame\nnumber. It is a pattern that evolves in time!\nAfter arg was defined, lots of other patterns and functions were\ncreated. Patterns that opened images, functions that took the mean of\npatterns, etc.\nProblems with lack of states.\nHowever, the design choice of abolishing internal states could only me\nso far. I wanted to create transitions between patterns and patterns\nsuch as the snake game.\nTo solve the problem of transitions, using closure, transitions keep\ntrack of how much it has already transitioned between patterns. Because\nof this, it is hard to modify the transitions themselves without changes\nin the code.\nTo create patterns with internal states, the solution was similar,\ncertain patterns could have access to an internal dictionary that keeps\ntrack of its internal state. As with the transtions, the internal state\ncan't be modified by other patterns. Even with those limitations, those\npatterns could make extensive use of the rest of the functions. As soon\nas I created a snake game pattern it was possible to blur the snakes,\nchange their color and make them brighter and darker with the rithm..\nOther small detais\nThis covers most of the development of the software. The audio\ninformation are functions inside the pattern input, and any pattern can\nmake use of the audio.\nThe leds make use of a linear color profile, and therefore I had to\nconvert the colors from SRGB to linear before sending the data through\nUDP.\nThe code was meant to be easy to develop and use, not meant to be fast.\nIn order to run it at fast speeds, you need to use pypy.\n","description":"","id":"/led-panel.html","title":"Led Panel"},"/linear-panorama.html":{"body":"Summary:\nPhotographing linear panoramas of murals, in a place with poor light conditions, and short distance to the wall.\nIntro\nPhotographing the murals in my dorm is a really challenging task. The\ndistance between the walls in the corridor is between 1.5m to 1.7m and\nthe height of the murals is approximately 2m.\nBesides this, I don't have any special device to illuminate the walls,\nbesides a simple octopus floor lamp with yellowish incandescent lights.\nGiven these constrains I photographed the murals, and made the following\nlinear panoramas (click for full size)\n\n\nHardware\n\nCanon T2i with Magic Lantern\ninstalled\nOpteka 6.5mm (Also known as Samyang 8mm, it is the same lens sold by\na different company)\nOctopus floor lamp (any floor lamp would work)\nTripod (set to around 1m)\n\nSoftware\n\nEnfuse\nMacrofusion\nHugin\n\nWork Flow\nCalibrate the Lens.\nIf your lens are not calibrated, this should be the first step, if not,\nskip this session. At first, take a picture of a mural in a way that\nthere are many clear straight lines in the image. Load the image in\nHugin. The follow the\ninstruction on Hugin to calibrate your lens. Instead of using a diagonal line,\nwhich might be hard to find, you can use multiple horizontal and\nvertical lines. However, do not choose horizontal line on the options.\nIf you are using a non standard lens, such as the Samyang 8mm, it is\nsometimes better to calibrate the lens for the approximate distance that\nyou are gonna take the pictures from.\nTaking the pictures.\nSet your tripod to be about half of the right of the wall your are\nphotographing (in case it is very near you). If it is farther, or you\nare not using fish-eye lens this won't affect you much.\nSet your camera to fully manual mode, set the ISO to the lowest setting\n(in order to minimize noise), set the focus to manual mode, and also set\nthe white balance to manual mode. It doesn't matter what setting you\nchoose for the white balance.\nTake multiple pictures, moving the position of the lights between each\npicture, but do not move the camera. This will assure you that you have\nthe whole scene well illuminated. Besides this, by having your light\ncoming from multiple directions, the end result will have even light,\nwhich considerably improves the quality of the image (It makes it look\nlike a scanner)\nIn order to not move the camera, you should use a shutter cable, or\nusing the LCDsensor Remote\nshoot on shooting preferences of Magic Lantern, if you use a canon dlsr.\n[)\n[)\n[)\nFusing the images\n:CUSTOM_ID: fusing-the-images\nTo fuse the images, you should use\nEnfuse. Enfuse is a command line\ntool for exposure fusing (it can also )\nIn order to better enfuse the pictures I recommend\nMacrofusion.\nMacrofusion is a fast, simple and responsive GUI for Enfuse. Macrofusion\nmakes it easy to choose the weights of exposure, contrast and saturation\nwhen fusing the images.\n)\nStraightening the images.\nOpen the image in Hugin, and load the lens configuration for your lens.\nChoose a rectilinear projection in Hugin's fast preview window.\n[)\nThis should have straightened up the image. But there should still be\nperspective problems. Set the horizon and vertical lines in the control\npoints tab and optimize the lens parameters. A full tutorial can be seen\non\nHugin's\nSourceForge page\nMost of the times, Hugin white balance correction in the preview window\nis enough to fix the image colors. And you just need to stitch the\nimage.\n)\nTaking the other pictures\nMove the camera to a new position and leave some overlap between the\nimages. It doesn't matter how much overlap you are leaving between the\nimages, in general, what matters is that the images overlap in a line\nthat can contain small errors.\nStitching\nThe images of the linear panorama should be added one at a time,\ntherefore, you should start with a image that would be in the middle and\nthen move to the corners. Since this is a tutorial I will stitch only 2\nimages.\n)\nLoad both of the images in Hugin, choosing the type of lens to be\nrectilinear and choose some small value for the focal length, such as\n10mm.\nSet the control points between the images (you can also add lines) and\nchoose custom parameters for the geometric optimization. You should\nprobably set them by hand.\n)\nAll but one picture parameters should be constant, because we are always\nadding one image at a time. For the picture that you are optimizing, you\nshould optimize X, Y and HFOV. Since the pictures are already straight,\nyou shouldn't need to optimize roll.\nIf this optimization is not enough, you can optimize for other\nparameters, but it is usually not necessary.\nIf there are areas between the images that don't match very well in\ntheir intersection, it is generally better to add a mas in order to use\nthe result from a single image.\nChoose custom parameters for photometric optimization. Again, always\nchange only one image at a time. The parameters that you should optimize\nare EV, Er and Eb. Optimizing the lens parameters usually result in poor\nblending for linear panoramas.\nAdding masks\nIf the images don't perfectly match on top of each other, you have 2\noptions:\n\nTry to optimize other lens parameters\nAdd masks to include certain parts of an image or remove it from\nothers.\n\nGenerally adding masks is faster and results in fewer problems.\nYou should also use masks to force Hugin to choose the image that has\nthe best resolution for areas where the details are important.\nStitching\nAfter you've added all the images it is time to stitch. If you are\nstitching to JPG, you should keep the canvas size's dimensions below\n232-1.\nChoose exposure fused from any arrangement, click in calculate optimal\nsize if you simply want the largest resolution possible, and stitch!\n[)\n\nMural stitched using only 2 control points\nCongratulations! You've finished your linear panorama.\nCommon Problems\nThe horizon might start to bend. In order to fix this, create a horizon\nline accross pictures, by adding control points for the horizon line\nacross different images.\n","description":"","id":"/linear-panorama.html","title":"Linear Panorama"},"/long-name-problems.html":{"body":"My name in my passport fairly long.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, I'd recommend putting\non headphones and listening to the\nvirtual barber shop.\nWhat makes audio binaural?\nIn few words, you can detect from which location a sound is coming from\nby detecting the delay (difference in phase) between the ears, which can\nreach $\\frac{25cm}{330m/s} \\approx 0.8ms$. However, we can localize the\nsource of a sound in 3 dimensions and the difference in phase only\nprovides us with one constraint. The rest of the information comes from\nhow frequencies are absorbed by the head, outer ear and body are\ndirection dependent; as well as the difference in audio intensity\nbetween the ears.\nPrograms that use HRTF\nThe response of each ear based on the direction of the sound is called\nHead-related transfer function (hrtf). Multiple programs can make use of HRTF in\norder to localize a sound source. Games that use\nopenal usually have a setting to activate\nHRTF if you are using headphones. One example of such game is Minecraft.\nAnother program is\npulseaudio.\nIt allows you to convert 5.1 audio into binaural audio by localizing the\nsound that would come from each of the speakers. This makes watching\nmovies with a headphone a fairly pleasing experience.\nBasic idea\nIt is easy to set up audio pipes using jack. I usually install\nCadence to do\nso, since it is extremely user friendly. Therefore, if I can setup a\nsimple jack application that uses a simple GUI to decide the location of\nan audio source and then play the audio on headphones, it should allow\nme to do things such as multiaudio or having some sound sound like it is\nmoving around me.\nAbout the tools\nJACK\n(Cadence)\n:CUSTOM_ID: jack-cadence\n\nJACK (JACK Audio Connection Kit) refers to an API and two\nimplementations of this API, jack1 and jack2. It provides a basic\ninfrastructure for audio applications to communicate with each other\nand with audio hardware. Through JACK, users are enabled to build\npowerful systems for signal processing and music production.\n\nIn other words, Jack provides an easy way to connect the audio from one\napplication to another. Using its C++ library we can easily make a\nclient that can take interface with the audio from other applications.\n\nCadence is a set of tools useful for audio production.\n\nCadence is a set of tools that make using JACK much easier. I have never\nbeen able to install JACK, nor use it without installing Cadence.\nZita Convolver\nInstall from libzita-convolver.\n\nZita convolver is a C++ library implementing a real-time convolution\nmatrix for up to 64 inputs and outputs. It uses multiple partition\nsizes to provide both low delay and efficient CPU use.\n\nIn other words, Zita Convolver is a very fast and simple way to apply an\nimpulse response to audio!\nQT\nI wanted the tool to have a gui. QT is one that is cross-platform.\n","description":"","id":"/multi-audio-in-development.html","title":"Multi-audio (In development)"},"/organizing-an-iap-class.html":{"body":"This IAP others 6.006 TAs and I organized 6.s092!\nMid semester I went to a SIPB meeting where they were discussing IAP classes and I decided that I decided that organizing a class would be a great idea. I convinced other 6.006 TAs to join and then said on the following sipb meeting we were doing it!\nAmong encouraging words such as \"why?\" \"that is a terrible idea\" and \"oh jeez\", we decided to move forward!\nand then ex 6.006 students came to help us as well!\nOrganizing a class is interesting! You need to decide things such as what classroom size will I need? How do I advertise the class? How do we decide on the grades? What are the topics of each lecture, of each pset? How do I distribute work for people? And so on.\nWe started with a room that could fit 50 people since who takes IAP classes taught by randoms, amiright? A few people were signing up for it since it was in the EECS website. But then everything changed:\nWe sent a silly email to dormspam\n\nTake the crash course in 6.006, first time ever being offered! It will\nbe a blast! This class, taught by 6.006 TAs, will try to cover all the\n6.006 material over IAP.\nListen to the encouraging words we heard when we decided to organize\nthis class:\n\"This is a terrible idea\" \"Good luck, you will need it\" \"Why?\"\n6.006 is an awesome 12 units class in algorithms and now you can take\nit in 12* hours! One hour per original unit! That is a steal!!**\n∗ (12 hours of lectures) + pset time.\n∗∗ You won't get 6.006 credit by taking this class though.\n\nThen in the end we got to 140 people and everyone was freaking out since that is a lot of people haha. We had to get bigger rooms, office hours rooms, microphones and etc. We were glad we didn't make elevator posters. In the end most people didn't show up to most of the lectures, so nothing matters.\nSince I'm super disorganized I though that trying to be the main person organizing the class would be a great learning experience.\nTo continue the path of terrible ideas, I decided that 30 psets over IAP seemed liked a great idea, together with the topic and objectives of each pset and lectures they went with.&nbsp; We have so many people helping with the class, what could go wrong? Also auto graded psets are not realy psets right?\nWell….\nTurns out that delegating things and organizing people is really hard! I thought that as long as we have a list of exactly what needs to be done and by when and people excited, things will get done.&nbsp; was I wrong….\nIn the first week of January after I had written 2 psets and setup a catsoop server and written example psets and guides to write questions and all, I had decided to give up and cancel the class, since no one else was helping with the class yet.\nI told JJ about this and she took over with an iron fist (just kidding, she was totally awesome and nice).\nShe messaged each person individually rather than messaging the group. She asked people to signup for tasks on the spot and did decided on reasonable (much shorter term) deadlines. And she met with people who wanted to help in person to make them feel more involved as well.\nEverything went super smoothly after that, I gotta say I learned a lot from seeing her organizing people much better than me.\nAnd now, lessons from the class, from an instructors perspective:\n– No one solves psets unless they have short term deadlines.\nAll of our psets had fake deadlines just to make students do them. If you give them the real deadline and it is a few weeks later, no one will do them.\nWe told the students all extensions would be approved but that they'd need to write us an email asking for them. Students hate writing emails so this was basically equivalent to a hard deadline.\nsecret: most classes have fake deadlines as well. The real deadline might be 15 minutes later, 1 day later or 2 weeks later depending on the class, because we hate having to deal with real extensions; fake extensions are much easier to deal with.&nbsp; This is true for all classes I've helped with. No, you will not know the real deadline as a student;\nthe deadline is fake to help the students.\nFake extensions mean: we can't even distinguish if you submitted it by the real extension or fake extension.\n– I can tell you guys are confused, but we are aiming for 70% understanding because of time constraints. Please, please, please use piazza and office hours, sorry the lecture is so short.\nIt is not hard to notice when students start feeling confused and to feel dumb when you have to move quickly on part of the material because you have a lot to cover. In a recitation you can simply decide to cover less material since most of it is review; but during a lecture you have to follow your syllabus.&nbsp; It is not the students fault, but more that we have a limited amount of time for lecture.\nIf we start mentioning or emailing out about office hours, piazza, etc. It is probably because we noticed people confused and we have more time available after the class time.\n– No one gives feedback. No one talks to the instructors\nEven though it is not that hard to tell if people are confused in a particular moment during the class, it is really hard to tell if people are enjoying the class or how much of it they are understanding.\nAs an instructor / TA in previous semesters, the thing we want the most is for the students to give feedback, be it good or bad. If we reach the point of directly asking for feedback a few times, it means that we are pretty desperate and have no clue how we are doing.\nI still don't know if people enjoyed the psets we wrote in January or found them useful, because no one said anything yet. So I'm just waiting for course evals.\nAs a short story, a friend of mine told an instructor I TAed with that we was rude on Piazza. He improved a lot in the following weeks\n– No one fills up course evals\nSince no one gives feedback, we just get really excited about course evals, because it is the one time people might finally say something. But no. No one fills up course evals unless you bother them like, 20 times.&nbsp; We only sent 3 emails + 1 in class announcement + 1 piazza post. So we had a 10% course eval filling rate.\nYeah, that is why instructors bother everyone so much with course evals or make people fill them up during lecture: no one cares enough to fill them up.\n– Instructors generally don't know what they are doing\nThis is true also for the classes I was a TA for. We are doing our best, but since most of the feedback only come through course evals, unless the same instructor is teaching the same class for the second or third time, they are just hoping for the best and not having any clue if things are going well or bad.\nFor example, if a single student tells an instructor that they like / dislike teal classes, this might very likely become the single reason a class starts being teal/stops being teal. This might or might not have been based in a real story lol.\nOne student told me that they liked the 6.s092 psets, so that is why I wrote extra optional pset questions for example.\n– Making it hard to get 100% is so fun!\nThis part is a bit evil. But as soon as some of the students in 6.s092 got 100% in the psets, I released a new very hard pset worth 0.03% of the grade. Which means that if they didn't do it, they'd only get a 99.97% average.\nThat is why sometimes there is extra credit or a single very hard question not worth much. We just want people to try to get even better!\n&nbsp;–\nSo yeah, it was exciting. Since I suck at organizing people I've decided that I'll be a grade Czar this semester (yes, that is my title in 6.042 lol. I'm responsible for organizing 25 graders and delegating tasks to make sure that all psets get graded in time.) This will be a disaster but I'll try my best. If you know anyone in 6.042 during the semester\ncomplaining that their pset grades are late, it will be my fault.\n","description":"","id":"/organizing-an-iap-class.html","title":"Organizing an IAP class"},"/pao-de-queijo-recipe-brazilian-cheese-bread.html":{"body":"Brazilian cheese bread is a super forgiving recipe: as long as you use tapioca flour and you don't underbake it, you can change the ingredients to your hearts content.\nLazy recipe\n\nabout 900g of tapioca flour/starch (if you have the option get \"polvilho azedo\", i.e. fermented tapioca starch, since it hydrates better). You can buy this at any Brazilian market\n2 cups of milk (hydration.

Around 1 tablespoon is reasonable (depends on the cheese)\n\nMix everything but the cheese and the tapioca flour.\nAdd tapioca flour until you can roll the dough into balls.\nAdd the cheese (it doesn't change the texture, so it is easier to add it last, to better tell the texture of the dough).\nRoll into balls (they can be tiny, or medium sized). Freeze them for later use, or bake them.\nBake them until the surface has hardened (it gets a bit brownish), between 350 and 375F. Small ones take 20 minutes, very large ones can take up to 40 minutes.\nIf baking a frozen one, add 2 minutes to the time that it took to bake the unfrozen one.\nSlightly better recipe\n(all substitutions above are still valid)\n\n700g of tapioca starch / polvilho azedo\n2 cups of milk\nhalf a cup of oil\n~ some salt (1 tablespoon of salt)\n2 big handfuls of cheese\n4 eggs\n\nMix milk, oil and salt and bring it to a boil.

We will use the term \"dimension\", in a very informal way. For example, if I have the vector $e_1$ and the vector $e_2$, and we \"sum\" their dimensions, we obtain $e_1 \\wedge e_2$. If we have the blade $e_1 \\wedge e_2$ and we remove the dimension $e^1$, we obtain $e^2$. \n$$a \\cdot (B \\wedge C)$$\nLets start with:\n$$a \\cdot (B \\wedge C)$$ , where $B$ and $C$ are $k$-blades with $k\\ge1$. What this formula is saying, intuitively, is that we take 2 blades, $B$ and $C$, we add their dimensions, to get a blade of higher dimension, and then we remove the dimensions of $a$.\nFor the product to not be null. at most one of $B$ or $C$ has the dimension of $a$. If it is $B$, then the formula is equivalent to \n$$(a \\cdot B) \\wedge C)$$\nBecause removing the dimension of $a$ from $B \\wedge C$, is equivalent to removing it from $B$, and then adding the dimension $C$.\nIf instead it is $C$, then, we need to remove the dimension of $a$ from $C$, so we will have a term $$\\pm? B \\wedge (a \\cdot C)$$, where we need to reason about what should the sign be. \nWe can split $C$ into 2 parts, $a \\wedge C'$, therefore we have \n$$a \\cdot(B \\wedge a \\wedge C') = a \\cdot(a \\wedge \\hat{B} \\wedge C') $$,\nwhere $\\hat{B}$ is the grade inversion of B, i.e. equal to $-B$, if $B$ is odd. Therefore, \n$$a \\cdot (B \\wedge C) = (a \\cdot B) \\wedge C) + \\hat{B} \\wedge (a \\cdot C)$$\nIn other words, when taking the dot product of a vector with a blade, we can just \"put\" the vector next to the terms it would cancel, while taking into account grade inversion. For exmple:\n$$e_1 \\cdot(e_2 \\wedge e^1 \\wedge e^3) = - e_2 \\wedge (e_1 \\cdot e^1 \\wedge e^3) = -e_2 \\wedge e_3$$\nContraction\nThe inner product/ dot product are slightly ambiguous. If we have $(A \\cdot B)$, we don't know if we are removing dimensions from $B$ or from $A$, i.e. supposing that $A$ is an $a$-blade and $B$ is a  $b$-blade, we don't know if  $(A \\cdot B)$ is an $a-b$-blade or $b-a$-blade, since we don't know which of them has the higher dimensions. So we define the left contraction inner product $A \\lrcorner B$  to be removing the dimensions of $A$ from $B$, i.e. an $a-b$-blade (or 0, if $b&gt;a$.\nWith this, we can think about:\n$$(A \\wedge B) \\lrcorner C =(A \\lrcorner (B \\lrcorner C))  $$\ni.e. removing the dimensions of both $A$ and $B$ from $C$ is the same as removing the dimensions of $B$ from $C$, and then removing the dimensions of $A$ from the result.\n","description":"","id":"/some-intuition-for-geometric-algebra-product-contractions-and-expansions.html","title":"Some intuition for Geometric Algebra product contractions and expansions"},"/the-first-of-many-brazilian-science-olympiads-guide-websites.html":{"body":"Until 2010 there were no website in Brazil one could access to learn about what science olympiads existed nor how to study for them. The only way to learn about the existence of the competitions was to randomly search the internet until you found one you didn't know about, or to study in a large school that prepared students for those competitions. However, even if you did find out about those competitions, there was no way for one to discover what books they should study or how to better prepare for the science olympiads. And for the small schools admins, it was hard for them to keep track of all the different dates where the competitions happened or when they should register for them!\nI was from a small town, and this had directly affected me, since I had to learn about the different competitions and prepare for them on my own. Because of this, once I moved to a larger city and started living away from family (when I was 15) to attend a larger school, I decided to start a blog and write about the main Brazilian Science Olympiads and how to study for them!\nProjeto Olímpico\nAfter writing it for about a month, there was enough interest from friends that we changed the hosting from wordpress to webnode, which allowed for a bit more customization.\nOlimpiadas.webnode.com.br\n\n\nAt this time, more people decided to join the project, and we became a team of 3 people.  We started receiving comments from students from all over Brazil, thanking us for the project. We started posting information about all the competitions as things happened. You could access our website to know what competitions had their registration open, which ones were releasing results and so on. We also improved our study guides and created pages for each science olympiad explaining what they were. We were even deciding on standards such as \"when writing a post about a result, the post contains a single image at the top with the symbol of the competition, and we end the post with 'congratulations to all the winners!'\".\nWe also bough our own domain! Olimpiadascientificas.com\nAbout 10 months later, in late 2011, our website got popular enough that Augusto, a student from very far away decided to help us! He had experience with creating websites and blogs, so we moved it to our own VM running wordpress!\nOlimpiadascientificas.com\n\nThe website kept growing and the team kept growing. In 2012, when I appeared on Tv, newspapers and magazines, I advertised the website and we were getting Approximately 500 visits per day!\nOur team was amazing, we had probably over 30 people. Most of them only contributed with a single post or so, while others contributes with dozens, and also many different pages or study materials.  I'd say that anyone in Brazil preparing for an International Science Olympiad was using our website.  There were people who lived near my small hometown who were preparing for the International Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad by using material we had shared, and they went to IOAA. \nWe kept doing things! We created the first Facebook group for people to share information about science olympiads, as well as the first Facebook page to share the news! At some point we had a twiter, and we had a Youtube channel where we were interviewing students and asking about their experiences!\nWe kept the lists of the Brazilians who had gone to International Science Olympiads as well as a list of the awards received by Brazil. We were producing our own study material, and expanding our list of competitions to State competitions as well! We were also keeping track of pictures of all the Brazilian teams in the multiple international science olympiads and sharing them.\nWe started another project, Vida de olímpico where people taking part in science competitions were writing blogs about their experiences. When I was in a small town, taking part in these competitions was a very lonely endeavor; by having a blog with other people sharing their experiences, the intention was to create a sense of community and also encourage people to keep going and keep studying and trying! Another intention was to debunk the myth that people taking part in those competitions had some type of divine gift that allowed them to be better than the others, since on the blogs we showed the amount of study that we had to put on. \nIn my personal \"vida de olímpico\" blog, I was receiving around 50 visits per day and many comments and I truly believed things were a bit better because of all the information sharing we were promoting!\nSome of the people who started writing those blogs, started writing them when they were just starting, and after a while they were traveling the world to go to science camps on trips they had won, and to International Science Olympiads! It was fantastic seeing their development! \nThe competitors and the downfall\nBut soon we started having people wanting to create their own websites about science olympiads, and then use their website to share their own facebook groups for people to study and discuss and so on. There was a split, and with most of the people in olimpiadascientificas graduating, we were not going to update the website as often and it was harder to find people to take over for us, since they went to other websites.  Then there were some problems with one of the people in the team deleting all the other people from our team and I not handling it very well. So our website kinda died.\nThe final blows to the website were when we stopped maintaining our wordpress server and because of vulnerabilities the website stopped being able to load. And later on, when we forgot to renew the domain and lost it.\nOur main \"competitor\" is still going strong, and they copied multiple parts of our style to the dot! Which makes me happy, because even though our website mostly died, there are still others doing exactly what we wanted to do! And they have enough people in their team that they can focus on producing original content rather than just reporting news! More producing knowledge rather than just sharing how to access knowledge. I  just wish the menu on their website was easier to use, since I find it very hard to find the study page for any of their subjects, since it involves 3 clicks and accessing 3 different pages, and I also wish that they had a more searchable name, so that other people would more readily find them instead of us.\nOur second main competitor went through the same rabbit hole we went once, but they went much deeper. In order to make their website cooler, they started adding more and more plugins, and images and javascript and all. It has reached the point where their website is so slow that I find it very bad to use… It is sad, since otherwise they'd be helping a lot more people than they currently are.\nThe memorial\n\nAfter all the problems with wordpress and realizing that I wouldn't be able to maintain the website, I made a \"memorial\". I converted the website to a static generated website in jekyll, so it would be much faster. I deleted the news and posts and kept only the rest: information about the main science olympiads, how to study, and information about the teams. However, the saddest part was converting the \"Vida de Olímpico\" blogs to fixed pages, by using a webscrapper, since they were also could not be used anymore because of the un-maintained wordpress problems…\nWe went from having 15k page views per day, on our most popular point, to now having only around 100 pageviews per day.

Then:\n$$\\frac{1}{A_n}\\oint_{\\partial M}  d\\mathbf{x^{n-1}} \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{|x|^n} = \\int_{ M}  d\\mathbf{x^n} \\delta_\\mathbf{x}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{cases}\n1,&amp; \\text{if the volume includes the origin}\\\n0,              &amp; \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nfor 3 dimensions you should recognize this equation from the electrical field of a point charge in the origin.\nUsing this with functions\nLet say you wanna find the $0$s of a function, and you are using the winding number algorithm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7FxPsqfkOY. \nTODO\n","description":"","id":"/winding-number-in-geometric-algebra.html","title":"Winding number in geometric algebra"}},"docInfo":{"/":{"body":174,"description":0,"title":1},"/10-things-to-smell-per-day.html":{"body":142,"description":0,"title":5},"/a-game-from-the-past.html":{"body":59,"description":0,"title":2},"/about.html":{"body":899,"description":0,"title":0},"/animating-gifs-in-orgmode.html":{"body":174,"description":0,"title":3},"/archived.html":{"body":125,"description":0,"title":1},"/automatic-latex-fragment-toggling-in-org-mode.html":{"body":451,"description":0,"title":6},"/baby-deer.html":{"body":172,"description":0,"title":2},"/baby-white-woodpeckers-are-dumb.html":{"body":275,"description":0,"title":4},"/blogging-past-and-not-blogging-rant.html":{"body":381,"description":0,"title":4},"/code.html":{"body":4201,"description":0,"title":1},"/college-essays-reblog.html":{"body":92,"description":0,"title":3},"/contact.html":{"body":14,"description":0,"title":1},"/disqus-and-javascript-random-thoughts.html":{"body":65,"description":0,"title":4},"/emacs-drag-drop-pdfs-paste-html-custom-templates.html":{"body":700,"description":0,"title":8},"/emacs-tramp-asking-for-password.html":{"body":46,"description":0,"title":4},"/error-compiling-openssl-for-android.html":{"body":23,"description":0,"title":4},"/export-subtree-with-files.html":{"body":447,"description":0,"title":3},"/groebner-basis-for-linear-network-coding-in-sage.html":{"body":11,"description":0,"title":6},"/hello-world.html":{"body":102,"description":0,"title":2},"/i3wm-screencasting-gifs.html":{"body":520,"description":0,"title":3},"/led-panel.html":{"body":957,"description":0,"title":2},"/linear-panorama.html":{"body":570,"description":0,"title":2},"/long-name-problems.html":{"body":131,"description":0,"title":3},"/magically-setup-emacsclient.html":{"body":154,"description":0,"title":3},"/make-cheap-headphones-sound-better-on-linux-ubuntu.html":{"body":104,"description":0,"title":7},"/making-zootycoon2-ultimate-edition-run-on-wine-on-ubuntu.html":{"body":79,"description":0,"title":7},"/me-and-animals.html":{"body":10,"description":0,"title":1},"/mit-entrepreneurship-resources.html":{"body":540,"description":0,"title":3},"/multi-audio-in-development.html":{"body":286,"description":0,"title":3},"/organizing-an-iap-class.html":{"body":754,"description":0,"title":3},"/pao-de-queijo-recipe-brazilian-cheese-bread.html":{"body":217,"description":0,"title":7},"/portfolio.html":{"body":733,"description":0,"title":1},"/projects-ideas.html":{"body":987,"description":0,"title":2},"/resetting-oneshot-original-2014-rpgmaker-on-wine-linux.html":{"body":13,"description":0,"title":7},"/resume.html":{"body":15,"description":0,"title":1},"/revista-contigo.html":{"body":24,"description":0,"title":2},"/scan-notes-with-laptop-webcam.html":{"body":764,"description":0,"title":4},"/simple-proof-weak-master-theorem.html":{"body":184,"description":0,"title":5},"/solving-a-problem-set-with-orgmode.html":{"body":307,"description":0,"title":4},"/some-intuition-for-geometric-algebra-product-contractions-and-expansions.html":{"body":270,"description":0,"title":6},"/the-first-of-many-brazilian-science-olympiads-guide-websites.html":{"body":686,"description":0,"title":7},"/transfer-functions-in-python.html":{"body":740,"description":0,"title":3},"/winding-number-in-geometric-algebra.html":{"body":181,"description":0,"title":4}},"length":44},"lang":"English"}
